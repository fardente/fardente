## Hello there, I'm Fernando :tada:

### I am a full stack developer with a background in computational linguistics / natural language processing and IT management consulting.

I started coding around 1997 with QBasic. From there started building websites using **PHP + HTML / CSS / JS** (and sometimes Flash :skull:). At university I learned **Java** and **Python**. I love doing things the :snake: pythonic way, but I'm amazed at how far JavaScript has come in the past 2 decades and developed a deep fondness for it during my time at the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at **SPICED Academy** in Berlin.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **TypeScript** and **GSAP**
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for entry level jobs as a developer in **Berlin**
