### Hello there :tada:

I am a full stack developer with a background in computational linguistics and IT management consulting. I love to work hands-on to create elegant solutions for complex problems (sometimes the other way around). Having implemented complex natural language processing and machine learning algorithms I like the flexibility web technologies offer to build practical things that allow for a creative process. I have experience working for a variety of clients from big corporations to public service providers.
