## Hello there, I'm Fernando :tada:

### I am a full stack developer with a background in computational linguistics / natural language processing and IT management consulting.

I love to work hands-on to create elegant solutions for complex problems (sometimes the other way around). Having implemented complex natural language processing and machine learning algorithms I like the flexibility web technologies offer to build practical things that allow for a creative process. I have experience working for a variety of clients from big corporations to public service providers. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white"/> and ** GSAP **
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for entry level jobs as a developer in ** Berlin **
